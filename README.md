# Python Repository (by KatchyPotato)
This repository contains all of the Python projects I work on and complete. They start out small and simple, and gradually get more complex as I progress in my journey as a developer. What you should expect to find here: 
1. Completed Projects
2. Projects in progress (Progress range varies)
3. Mostly single-file projects

I have been developing games on Scratch for multiple years now, and have been learning to code in Python for the past month. My Scratch Account can be accessed with [This Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Katchy_Potato/) 

Every file here should run in IDLE and VS code. Have a good day! ❤️
